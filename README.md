## Introduction

Work and daily schedulers can provide more organization in order to maximize one's productivity and time management. The foundation of the daily scheduler utilizes html as the structure of our password generator, CSS to style the content and cosmetics of the generator, and JavaScript to input the functionality of the website to be able to generate a unique daily work schedule via a series of inputs given a user's provided criteria. Users can create daily schedules by opening the daily planner, viewing the current day at the top of the website, and then by scrolling down to view standard 9am-5pm business hours. Blocks will indicate whether the planned event is in the past, present, or future. Users will be able to click on the block and enter an event and then click the save button to save their entry to local storage. When the page is refreshed, the inputted events in the daily planner persist. 

## Usage
1. Open the daily scheduler URL in browser.
2. Edit blocks to add daily events by time and save planned events. 

## Configuration
Built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
