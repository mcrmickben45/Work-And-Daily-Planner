## Introduction

The integration of work and daily schedulers constitutes an effective approach for enhancing productivity and optimizing time management. This project leverages HTML as the foundational structure for the daily scheduler, utilizes CSS for refining the visual aesthetics and styling of the scheduler, and employs JavaScript to imbue the website with functionality, enabling the generation of a bespoke daily work schedule based on user-specified criteria. Users can seamlessly create daily schedules by accessing the daily planner, observing the current day prominently displayed at the webpage's apex, and subsequently navigating through standard 9 am to 5 pm business hours. The delineated blocks within this timeframe distinctly indicate whether a planned event resides in the past, present, or future temporal context. Facilitating user engagement, the interface allows for the entry of events upon clicking a designated block, with a subsequent save operation that persists the inputted data to local storage. Notably, the durability of user entries transcends temporary browser sessions, ensuring the sustained availability of the recorded events even after the page is refreshed.

## Usage
1. Open the daily scheduler URL in browser.
2. View current day.
3. Navigate to business hours.
4. Identify past, present, and future blocks. 
5. Enter event information, save entry, and view persisting entries.
